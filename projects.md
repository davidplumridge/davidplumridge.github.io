<p>A solution to help travellers find a place to store their luggage before check-in or aftery checked-out. The typical customer is an AirBnB or short stay guest. I'm a a solo-founder who developed the entire tech stack while scaling the service into ~20 cities (in under 6 months).</p>

<h4>easy deals online (sold)</h4>
<p>An ecommerce company that started as a reference store using totallister (see below). I partnered with various suppliers around Australia by listing their products for sale across multiple channels. Shortly after the monthly revenue exceeded 6 figures monthly, I sold the business.</p>

<p>Originally the project started with the goal to help manage eBay listings for companies with 1000's of SKU's. At the time, there was limited options. The project pivoted into a SaaS project that helped companies to manage their multi-channel product listings (ebay, amazon, shopify, magento), customer orders, shipping and customer service.</p>
