# A list of things I've made

<h4><a href="https://mindmybag.com">mindmybag</a></h4>
<p>A convenient luggage storage solution for Australia & New Zealand. We service customers who are waiting to check-in or have already checked-out out of their AirBNB or Hotel. As the solo founder, I built the entire tech stack and scaled into approximately 20 cities in less then 6 months.</p>

<h4><a href=".">totallister</a> (now inactive)</h4>
<p>A multi-channel eCommerce solution for managing inventory, product listings, orders and customer service. The front end was an eCommerce site that grew to ~AUD $100k monthly revenue. Exited by selling to another Australian company.</p>
